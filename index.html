  <h2>Deference between if/else and switch</h2>
  <p>
    if/else and switch are both control flow operations.  Control flow operations
    allow you to control the order of the execution and whether to execute certain operations.
  </p>
  <p>
    If/else has the following diagram. 
  </p>
  <div class="code-section">
    <code>
      &nbsp      if(statements) { <br>
      &nbsp  &nbsp        // if section <br>
      &nbsp  &nbsp        //one or more statements <br>
      &nbsp      } else { <br>
      &nbsp  &nbsp        // else section <br>
      &nbsp  &nbsp        //one or more statements <br>
      &nbsp      } <br>
    </code>
  </div>
  <p>
    The program reaches if statement it evaluates the statement in the parenthesis if statements is true it will evaluate everything
    in the brackets.  If there is an else at the end of the if section evaluate the else section if the statement was false.  In Java you can omit
    the brackets if the section has only one line.  You can also chain several if/then statements by putting an if right after else like the following
  </p>
  <div class="code-section">
    <code>
    } else if(statement){ <br>
    </code>
  </div>
  <p>
    Switch has the fallowing diagram
  </p>
  <div class="code-section">
    <code>
      &nbsp switch(value){ <br>
      &nbsp &nbsp case compareValue: <br>
      &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp      //one or more statements <br>
      &nbsp &nbsp case compareValue: <br>
      &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp      //one or more statements <br>
      &nbsp &nbsp default : <br>
      &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp      //one or more statements <br>
      &nbsp } <br>
    </code>
  </div>
  <p>
    When the program reaches switch statement it will compare the value in parenthesis to the values in the case statement.  If it matches
    one of the compareValues it will execute all statements from that point down including statements after all the other case statements,
    unless it runs into a break.  If it runs into a break it stops executing statements and exits the whole switch statements.  If the program does
    not find a match then it does not execute any thing unless there is a default statement then it executes everything after the default.
  </p>
  <p>
    The important difference between the two is that if/else allows you to check if something is true or false and switch compare a value to a
    list of values.  You can chain if/else instead switch, but switch is easier to read.
  </p>
  <p>
    If you want to want to do certain thing in your program based on whether is true or not use if/else. Like if it’s after 5 you display a closed
    sign and if it’s before an open sign.
  </p>
  <div class="code-section">
    <code>
      &nbsp If(time > 5) <br>
      &nbsp &nbsp  System.out.print(“Closed”); <br>
      &nbsp else <br>
      &nbsp &nbsp  System.out.print(“Open”); <br>
    </code>
  </div>
  <p>
    If you want to compare a value to a list use switch.  Like if you had “Hello World” and wanted to display it
    on the screen, but using different languages you would use switch
  </p>
  <div class="code-section">
    <code>
      &nbsp switch(language){ <br>
      &nbsp &nbsp  case “german”: <br>
      &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp System.out.print(“Hallo Welt”); <br>
      &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp break; <br>
      &nbsp &nbsp  case “english”: <br>
      &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp System.out.print(“Hello World”); <br>
      &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp break; <br>
      &nbsp &nbsp case “turkish”: <br>
      &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp System.out.print(“Selam Dunya”); <br>
      &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp break; <br>
      &nbsp &nbsp default : <br>
      &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp System.out.print(“sorry I don’t know that”) <br>
      &nbsp } <br>
    </code>
  </div>
  <h2>What is the difference between “=“ vs “==“ .equals()</h2>
  <p>
    “=“ is used to assign the value on the right to variable on the left.
  </p>
  <p>
    “==“ is used to compare two primitive values like int, float, boolean, char. If the
    value on the left is the same as the value on the right it will return true.  If not it
    will return false .  It can be used on other things like string and object
    but, I will only return true if they point to the same area in memory.
  </p>
  <div class="code-section">
    <code>
      &nbsp 10 == 10 // true <br>
      &nbsp 1 == 3     // false <br>
      &nbsp A == A    // true <br>
      &nbsp A == a.   // false <br>
    </code>
  </div>
  <p>
    .equals() is used to compare content of object like strings. It is method of the object.
    If object contain same value it returns true.  If not it returns false.
  </p>
  <div class="code-section">
    <code>
      &nbsp String a = “hi” , b = “bye”, c = “hi”; <br>
      <br>
      &nbsp a.equals(“hi”)       // true <br>
      &nbsp a.equals(“bye”)    // false <br>
      &nbsp a.equals(c)          // true <br>
      &nbsp a.equals(b).         // false <br>
    </code>
  </div>
  <h2>Math object</h2>
  <p>
    Math is class built into java that contains several math related static
    members and methods. That means you can use them without substantiate the
    class.  In java names of classes are capitalized.  That is why it’s Math and not math.
  </p>
  <p>
    Math.random() returns a random double value between 0 and 1 including 0 but never 1.
  </p>
  <h2>Return types</h2>
  <p>
    If a method has return type of void it means it does not return any value.
    If you declare a return type the program expect return type in the declaration.
    Here are some examples.
  </p>
  <div class="code-section">
    <code>
      &nbsp plusOneVoid(4); // displays 5 on screen <br>
      &nbsp System.out.print(plusOneReturn(4)); // displays 5 on screen <br>
      <br>
      &nbsp public static void plusOneVoid(int a){ <br>
      &nbsp &nbsp System.out.print(a + 1); <br>
      &nbsp } <br>
      <br>
      &nbsp public static void plusOneReturn(int a){ <br>
      &nbsp &nbsp return a + 1; <br>
      &nbsp } <br>
    </code>
  </div>
  <p>
    Both of these methods add one to number, but plusOneVoid() writes to the
    screen and returns nothing.  While plusOneReturn() adds returns a value when called.
  </p>
  <h2>Casting a double to an int</h2>
  <p>
    Double holds a value that often times contains number with a decimal point like 1.99, 2.34.
    There is times you just want an integer value.  You can convert a double to an integer by
    putting a (int) front of it.  Here is some examples
  </p>
  <div class="code-section">
    <code>
      &nbsp (Int) 99.99 // 99 <br>
      &nbsp (Int) 2.78   // 2 <br>
    </code>
  </div>
  <p>
    When you do this the number after decimal get dropped and number before decimal gets returns
  </p>
  <p>
    One example where you would want to use this is when generating random number.  Since Math.random() only generates a double between 0 and .999999… you can’t get integers
    from it.  One way to get integers from Math.random() multiply there return with an integer than cast it to a int. Here a example
  </p>
  <div class="code-section">
    <code>
      &nbsp (Int)(Math.random() * 6) //gives you a range between 0 and 5 <br>
      &nbsp ((Int)(Math.random() * 10) + 1) // gives you range between 1 and 10 <br>
    </code>
  </div>
